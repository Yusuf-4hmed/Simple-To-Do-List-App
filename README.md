This project was built alongside a tutorial just as a way for me to improve my JavaScript skills, but we all know that blindly following tutorials isn't the most effective way to learn ðŸ™‚

Which is why I will be updating this project in the future independenty:
- [ ] Add a github style contribution graph but for to-do lists being checked off
- [ ] Add a motivational quote generator
- [ ] Add some site customisation


### Built With

I started this project at a time where I did not have any experince with any Libraries or Frameworks hence why this project was done in vanilla languages.

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
